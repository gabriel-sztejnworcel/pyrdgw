# PyRDGW
Remote Desktop Gateway protocol server-side [MS-TSGU] implementation in Python 3.

Remote Desktop Gateway is a Windows Remote Desktop Services feature that provides an RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connection over a secure HTTP tunnel. The main use case is to allow users to connect from the internet to servers inside the corporate network without the need for a VPN.

The idea behind the project is to provide a cross platform light implementation of the protocol to enable better deployment options for cloud environments, such as containers and container orchestration services.
